Generate Weekly Report
======================

This is script compiles a report in Markdown format of all the tasks marked completed in [OmniFocus][1] for the past week, along with all the projects currently active, and adds it to a group in a [DEVONthink Pro][2] database. It's written so that the handlers that retrieve data from OmniFocus could be easily re-used in something else.

It was originally based on a [post][3] to the OmniFocus forum, although it's been completely rewritten.
